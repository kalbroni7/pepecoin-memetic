# PepeCoin - PEPE  / Memetic - MEME
#### v. 3.1.1.0

Memetic, also known as PepeCoin, is a digital decentralized crypto-currency, listed as as Memetic / MEME on Bittrex, Upbit, Coinmarkets, and CoinMarketCap.

Memetic, AKA PepeCoin, incorporates both blockchain 2.0 and blockchain 3.0 technologies and is under continued development.

Memetic / Pepecoin is a Proof of Stake (POS) cryptocurrency with privacy features and masternode technology. Mastertoad (masternode) and stakers are rewarded for processing transactions and collectively ensuring the security of the network.

Previously, we were a Proof of Stake and Proof of Work hybrid but due to the rise of 51% attacks we have shifted to POS until more technology improvements are discovered.

Memetic / PepeCoin is decentralized, encrypted image storage in IPFS, cryptographically verified against the PepeCoin blockchain. Protect your memes and political information from censorship.

Memetic / PepeCoin is the base infrastructure for the Kekdaq decentralized meme asset exchange.

PepeCoin is a fully open source, decentralized, encrypted project that supports the preservation of all freedom of speech that is within the bounds of US law.
